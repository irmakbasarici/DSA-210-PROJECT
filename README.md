# Obesity Data Analysis - DSA210 Project

## Project Overview
This project analyzes the relationship between eating habits, physical activity, and obesity levels using a dataset from Kaggle. The dataset includes data from individuals in Mexico, Peru, and Colombia, featuring 17 attributes related to dietary habits, physical condition, and obesity classification.

The objective is to identify key lifestyle factors influencing obesity and apply data science techniques to classify individuals into different obesity levels.

## Objectives
1. **Understand Lifestyle and Obesity Correlation**  
   - Analyze the impact of eating habits, physical activity, and other lifestyle factors on obesity.

2. **Identify Key Contributors to Obesity**  
   - Determine which attributes (e.g., caloric intake, exercise, technology use) have the highest impact on obesity levels.

3. **Develop a Predictive Model**  
   - Train machine learning models to classify individuals into different obesity categories.

4. **Apply Data Science Skills**  
   - Implement statistical analysis, visualization, and machine learning techniques in Python.

## Dataset Information
The dataset consists of **2111 records** with the following attributes:

- **Demographics:** Gender, Age, Height, Weight
- **Eating Habits:** Family history of obesity, frequency of high-caloric food, vegetable consumption, meal frequency, snacking habits
- **Lifestyle Factors:** Smoking, water consumption, calorie tracking, physical activity, technology use, alcohol consumption, transportation method
- **Target Variable:** **Obesity Level** (Insufficient Weight, Normal Weight, Overweight I/II, Obesity I/II/III)

---

## Tools & Technologies
- **Python**: Data processing and model development
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Visualization (correlation heatmaps, scatter plots)
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning for classification
- **SciPy**: Statistical hypothesis testing

---

## Analysis Plan
### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
   - Summary statistics
   - Missing values handling
   - Data distributions & visualizations

### 2. Data Visualization
   - Correlation heatmap to show relationships between features
   - Scatter plots for key variable relationships
   - Box plots to compare obesity levels

### 3. Hypothesis Testing
   - Statistical tests to determine the impact of variables on obesity.
   - **Null Hypothesis (H₀):** There is no significant relationship between lifestyle factors (eating habits, physical activity, etc.) and obesity levels.
   - **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁):** Lifestyle factors (eating habits, physical activity, etc.) have a significant impact on obesity levels.

### 4. Machine Learning Model
   - Train classification models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, etc.)
   - Evaluate performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

## Expected Outcomes
By the end of this project, we aim to:
- Determine which factors contribute most to obesity.
- Provide insights for obesity prevention based on data-driven findings.
- Develop a predictive model for obesity classification.

---

## Conclusion
This project will serve as a structured analysis of obesity determinants using real-world data. By leveraging data science techniques, we aim to derive meaningful insights that can help in obesity prevention and management strategies. The findings can be used to promote healthier lifestyles and inform public health decisions.
